You don't even need your local server installed; just click on the \"try classic notebook\" button and their jupyterHub will spin up a remote server and give you some temporary files on Binder for you to try it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should throw you into a notebook called *Index* with links to seven additional tutorial notebooks.  You should find all of these interesting, but the essential concepts for us to get started are in the first three:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notebook Basics\n",
    "* IPython - beyond the plain python\n",
    "    * up to and including the section on *Running code in other languages with special %% magics*. You don't need to know all those languages, but we will be referring to HTML, javascript, css, svg, R and python at some point during this course.\n",
    "* Markdown cells\n",
    "    * do not use the link to daringfireball markdown specification. It talks about different markdown tools we don't need so it's just confusing. Things like the [github markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) is more compact and handy if you are new to markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if the Binder service is too busy to launch a server, you can try the copies I downloaded from [the github repo](https://github.com/ipserverython/ipython-in-depth):\n",

    "\n",
    "There are plenty of introduction to jupyter videos: most of them show you how to set up a local server and a few things you can do in Jupyter. I particularly like [Corey Schafer's introduction on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an extensive [gallery of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks) on GitHub.\n",

    "## <xnum>1.2</xnum> Setting up jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To work on and understand jupyter notebooks you'll want to install Jupyter (which really means installing your own Jupyter server) on your own machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic install instructions are available at <https://jupyter.org/install>. There are two main variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most online guides suggest using *anaconda* as a package manager for installing Jupyter, which can be convenient since it also can be used to install the python and R kernels.  This may be the best choice in a Windows environment.\n",
    "* However, I prefer to use a python virtual environment and pip for managing Jupyter under a Ubuntu distribution, since ubuntu already has a package manager, and I already had a python and R distribution installed. It also seems to work fine, but I have to be careful which versions of python and R I am using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider installing jupyter in a virtual environment. If you're not familiar with virtual environments, here's some pointers:\n",
    "* It does not add any program features, but provides an alternative to installing new libraries across your entire operating system. \n",
    "    * putting your installation in a virtual environment separates the libraries and configuration from other projects and installations on your machine.  This is really helpful if (1) you want multiple environments for conflicting installations - different installations for different projects or courses; and (2) if some library or installation messes up your applications or file system, only the virtual environment should be affected. Most likely everything will still work outside the environment. \n",
    "* conda has a virtual environment tool you can use, which I have never tried, but might be the more consistent if you install using anaconda. \n",
    "* jupyter.org tutorials also mention pipenv but I prefer to use the python venv standard library, because it has a smaller footprint in terms of storage requirements. YMMV.\n",
    "* <span class=notcovered>you can find tutorials that suggest Docker or a virtual machine for portability of your entire jupyter server environment. This is overkill for the limited purpose of doing a course.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to understand the difference between using Jupyter remotely or locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* set up a local server to run on your own machine per the above instructions\n",
    "* the *jupyter nbconvert* tool converts notebooks into a static form that doesn't need any jupyter server - but you get a web page  in which the code cells won\\'t be interactive.\n",
    "* You should also be able to use a JupyterHub server set up for this course; this will be good for sharing notebooks and testing that your notebook submissions work as expected\n",
    "* <span class=\"notcovered\">Several online tutorials show how to use SSH port forwarding to remotely access a jupyter server. Apparently this is common practice. However, the Jupyter docs indicate how to set up SSL encyption over HTTPS which seems to me to be the \"correct\" way to access a private remote server.</span>\n",
    "* <span class=\"notcovered\">there are also a variety of online services that provide servers you can use, such as Google CoLab (and these online services tend to have their own extensions and add-ons integrated to some degree with jupyter notebooks). I'm personally not keen on the trend of handing all your resource management and work information over to a service provider, but there are lots of benefits from doing this: including a support community that will help you.</span>\n",
